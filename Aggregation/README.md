 To assist researchers who prefer to work at the contract (rather than contract‑action) level, we provide an aggregated derivative of the corpus together with the Python script that creates it. The script, `aggregate_fpds_contract_level.py`, streams each monthly Parquet shard, groups rows by `content.ID.ContractID.PIID`, sums numeric fields (e.g., `content.DollarsObligated`) and keeps the first non‑null value of categorical variables, then writes a single file `fpds_contract_level.parquet` that contains one row per contract. On a standard laptop (≤ 16 GB RAM) the job finishes in roughly 30 minutes. Both the script and the resulting ≈ 4 GB contract‑level dataset are available in the repo; users can adjust the aggregation rules by editing the clearly marked configuration block at the top of the script.
